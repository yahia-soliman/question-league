# Question League
### A platform with competitive multiplayer questions.

I'm still working in this project, expected to deploy a usable website before 10 May 2024  
This project was a good playground for me, I learned a lot of things, especially in SQLAlchemy ORM, realtime connections websockets, Server Sent Events with the Puplisher/Subscriber design pattern, Python Asyncio, Threading, TailwindCSS, basic web animations and a lot more things, and yet more to come.  
Feel free to start a discussion about anything in this project, by github discussions or by contacting me [yahia-soliman](https://github.com/yahia-soliman).  

### Backend
**Ptyhon:** SQLAlchemy, Flask, Pytest.

### Frontend
**JavaScript:** Just vanilla, there is tons of features that browers support natively no need for a framework, I would consider TypeScript but on a larger scale  
**CSS:** using tailwindcss  
**HTML:** with Jinja templates
